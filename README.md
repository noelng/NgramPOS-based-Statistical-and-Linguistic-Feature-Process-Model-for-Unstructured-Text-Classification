# Stock Price Prediction Using Sentiment Analysis

The stock market prediction has been one of the highly challenging problems 
in the field of machine learning due to the stock price movements that are known to be 
highly random, non-linear and non-stationery. In recent years, various feature 
processing and machine learning techniques such as Ngram, Part of Speech tagging, 
Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency, Chi-Square and Truncated SVD have 
been applied on news headlines and online investing forum threads in text 
classification to predict share price movement. This project aims to compare the 
performance impact of these complementary feature processing techniques and 
different combination of classification model algorithms as well as to propose an 
overall framework that produces the best predictive performance on short-term stock 
price movements. The final proposed framework of UniBi-POS-TF-IDF-SVD with 
XGBoost has shown significant average accuracy of 84.19% over all other 
experimented framework.
